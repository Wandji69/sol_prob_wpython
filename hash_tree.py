# Analysis
# Using one while loop and 3 for loops
# 4 spaces : 1 hash
# 3 Spaces : 3 hash
# 2 spaces : 5 hash
# 1 space : 7 hash
# 0 space : 9 hash
# top of tree should be equall bottom

# Need to do:
# 1. Decrement spaces by 1 every time through loop
# 2. Increment hashs by 2 two each time through loop
# 3. Save space to stump by calculation tree height - 1
# 4. Decrement from tree height until it equal 0 
# 5. Print spaces and then hashes for each row
# 6. Print stump space and then 1 hash
